# Neural Networks @ FIIT

This repository contains supporting materials for the subject __Neural Networks__ (@ FIIT STU).

It is a very important repository, you will find here the assignments prepared for you, for the first 4 weeks of the semester.

## Course Information
- __Weekly tasks [7+3 pts]:__ First 3 weeks (after this one), you will work on the same tasks for better understanding of how neural networks work.
- __Projects [7 pts, 10 pts, 18 pts]:__ You will work in pairs on 3 deep learning project with gradually increasing difficulty throughout the entire semester. You will present your progress during the consultations, which are marked so you will be scored continuously and for the final presentations of your solutions.
  - (the nature of questions and problems on courses may be similar to the ones in midterm and exam)
- __Midterm [15 pts]:__ This is gonna be fun
- __Exam [40 pts]__ This is gonna be a nightmare \
(No worries, not for you, for me to create them... even after previous year ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

You'll find out more during the firs lecture - you are encouraged to ask any questions regarding the course.
### Feedback
- If you find any inconvenience or errors in the notebooks, just let us know (or make a pull request)...
- Any recommendations to the subject + topics = let us know...

### Python
We use _Python 3.7_+ compatible code in these notebooks, however it may work with older versions.
We assume that you have seen Python code before. If you have not, Week 1 is a quick dive-in course that may help.
You should learn the basics as soon as possible (e.g. [W3Schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)).

##  Week 1
This is a warm-up week and for some of you the __lecture is after your seminar__, so we'll take it easy on you. 
All you have to do is to prepare your computing environment. 
If you have never worked with Python, this is a good chance for you to start - you'll be using it a lot during this semester (or not, if you prefer C++).
We have prepared a few simple tasks that you can find in the directory "week_1" - Jupyter Notebook.
If you know all of that already, well ...then, congratulations ;)

But still... the attendance of the seminars is mandatory.

Regards, Igor

## Week 2
All hands on board!

This week, you are going to implement a simple multilayer perceptron with its feed forward function.
In the notebook, there are already prepared base classes and structures. 
Finish all the forward functions and run the visualization/print cells.
Follow the instructions in the notebook.

Of course - you don't have to do it before the seminar... 
As stated during the lecture and seminars, this is your work for the upcoming week's seminars.
Also - don't forget to refresh your memory about matrix operations and perceptron's architecture.

Good luck,

Regards, Igor
